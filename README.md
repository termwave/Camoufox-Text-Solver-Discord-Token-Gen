## What is Glacier?

Glacier is an automated Discord account creation tool that helps you generate accounts efficiently. It mimics real user behavior, handles proxy rotation, and can solve captchas using AI assistance. The tool uses advanced browser automation to make the process feel natural and includes a clean, colorful terminal interface.

## What Can It Do?

**Runs Multiple Tasks at Once**  
Create several Discord accounts simultaneously without slowing down your system.

**Smart Captcha Solving**  
Uses Groq AI and LLaMA models to automatically handle hCaptcha challenges when they pop up.

**Acts Like a Real Person**  
Moves the mouse naturally, types at human speed, and adds random pauses to avoid detection.

**Proxy Support Built-In**  
Automatically reads and switches between proxies from your proxy list.

**Email Verification**  
Monitors your inbox through IMAP and grabs verification links automatically.

**Beautiful Console Output**  
Thread-safe logging with colors, timestamps, and gradient effects that make monitoring easy.

**Desktop Alerts**  
Get notifications on your desktop when accounts are created successfully or if something goes wrong.

3. Fill out Discord's registration form
4. Solve any captchas that appear (using AI or manual help)
5. Verify the account through email
6. Show you colorful progress updates in real-time

## How Captcha Solving Works

The AI solver is powered by Groq's LLaMA model:
- It detects when Discord throws up a captcha
- Automatically switches to text-based challenges
- Reads the question and figures out the answer
- Types the response just like a human would

## Setting Up Proxies

Add your proxies to `proxies.txt`, one per line. Supported formats:

```
http://user:pass@host:port
socks5://user:pass@host:port
host:port
```
